	I'm 19 and I'm from Albuquerque.
	I'm a major league baller with my fellow Apostles. We bad. My favorite team is the Spurs.
	I'm also partial to the Holy Roller Ballers and Holy Roller music group.

	<strong>ROARRRR!!!</strong>  Don't be afraid.
</p>
<p>That's how we do it at <strong>A.B.H.S!</strong>
</p>
There I got a lot of community work experience, when I'm not praying or balling with <strong>The Apostles</strong>.
I began to take a interest in coding, specifically <strong><em>biblical coding</em></strong>,
and that all <em>mighty</em> technology.
All through out highschool I wanted to go to culinary school. Because the Apostles do get hungry and need to be fed.
I make great holy bread. I eventually lost interest in
culinary and gained more of an interest in software development prayers.
