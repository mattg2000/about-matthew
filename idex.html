I graduated high school in 2019 from Amy Biehl High School. There I got a lot
of community work excperience and I also began to take a intrest in coding and technology.
All through out highschool I wanted to go to culinary school, but I eventually lost intrest in
culinary and gained more of an intrest in software development.
